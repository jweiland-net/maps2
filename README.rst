About this Repository
---------------------

maps2 is an extension for TYPO3 CMS. It can render you a map based on Google Maps and/or OpenStreetMap. If you
want, you can create Markers, Routes, Area and Radius overlays. Assign these overlays to categories to
build a map, with all points based on selected category.
