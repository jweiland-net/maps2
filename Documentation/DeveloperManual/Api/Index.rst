Maps2 API
=========

Maps2 comes with some public methods which we have marked with ``@api``. Use them
to simplify your life within your extensions when working with maps2.

Some of these methods work with Google Geocode API. So please check, if you have setup API Key
correctly in extension manager configuration of maps2.

Methods
-------

getFirstFoundPositionByAddress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Give it an address (string) as first argument and you will get first found address as Position object.
If Google Geocode has nothing found or an error occurs this method will return ``null``.
There is no need to PHP:rawurlencode the address as we will do it for you.

getPositionsByAddress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Give it an address (string) as first argument and you will get all found results from Google Geocode as
RadiusResult in an ObjectStorage.

.. important::
    Within the last years Google Geocode has changed something. It will always return exactly ONE result.
    So, in that case it may not make sense to call that method and switch to
    :ref:`getFirstFoundPositionByAddress <getFirstFoundPositionByAddress>` above.

createNewPoiCollection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use it, if you have some location records in your extension and want to create a new PoiCollection relation
automatically while saving your location record.

$pid (int)
**********

At which page (Table: pages) should we save the PoiCollection record for you?

$position (Position)
********************

To save a PoiCollection we need the latitude and longitude. It is good practise to retrieve such a
Position from getFirstFoundPositionByAddress above.

$overrideFieldValues (array)
****************************

We will prefill some fields like ``title`` with the formatted address of given ``Position`` object.
You want your own values? Use ``overrideFieldValues`` to override our prefilled values.
That way you can override every field of table ``tx_maps2_domain_model_poicollection``. We have added a check
against available fields in table. That way it is not possible to produce an invalid INSERT query.

Return value (int)
******************

The UID of the just created PoiCollection record

assignPoiCollectionToForeignRecord
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have over 5 extensions working together with maps2 and we always have to implement a part to save the
PoiCollection UID to our other extensions. Wouldn't it be better to have a centralized method doing that? Yes! So
here are the Arguments you should fill:

$poiCollectionUid (int)
***********************

Fill it with the PoiCollection UID you will get from ``createNewPoiCollection``.

$foreignRecord (array)
**********************

This is a table row of your extension. We use it as PHP:reference to add the new PoiCollection UID directly into
your foreign record.

$foreignTableName (string)
**************************

As we save the foreign extension record for you, we need the tablename where to save the record.

$foreignFieldName (string)
**************************

Default: tx_maps2_uid

As we save the foreign extension record for you, we need the fieldname where to save the UID of PoiCollection.

Example
-------

Here we have a working example out of our extension events2:

.. code-block:: php

    // create new map-record and set it in relation
    $position = $this->googleMapsService->getFirstFoundPositionByAddress($this->getAddress($eventLocation));
    if ($position instanceof Position) {
        $tsConfig = $this->getTsConfig($eventLocation);
        $this->googleMapsService->assignPoiCollectionToForeignRecord(
            $this->googleMapsService->createNewPoiCollection(
                (int)$tsConfig['pid'],
                $position,
                array(
                    'title' => $eventLocation['location']
                )
            ),
            $eventLocation,
            'tx_events2_domain_model_location',
            'tx_maps2_uid'
        );
    }
