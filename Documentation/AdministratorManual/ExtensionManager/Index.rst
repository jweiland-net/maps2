.. _extensionManager-mapProvider:

mapProvider
-----------

Decide, if you want to use Google Maps or OpenStreetMap in your project. If you're unsure you can keep both
active, but in that case you and/or your editor have the possibility to switch between Map Providers in
PoiCollection record.

.. important::
   If you keep both active you have multiple static extension templates available. You have to decide for one map
   provider in your TS-template record. And yes, you can't show maps of both map providers on the same page.

.. important::
   If you change from one Map Provider to another we remove the static extension template of the prior Map
   Provider from selection of your TS-template record.


.. _extensionManager-defaultMapProvider:

defaultMapProvider
------------------

This setting is only relevant if you have chosen ``both`` at mapProvider. c

.. important::
   If you keep both active you have multiple static extension templates available. You have to decide for one map
   provider in your TS-template record. And yes, you can't show maps of both map providers on the same page.


.. _extensionManager-defaultCountry:

defaultCountry
--------------

If a Google Maps Geocode Request will be requested with only a postal code,
Google Maps will try to find that postal code somewhere all over the world.
If your website is only available for one specified country, you can enter
a country name to reduce the Google Maps Position to given country. If you have
POIs all over the world you should keep that field empty.


.. _extensionManager-defaultLatitude:

defaultLatitude
---------------

Default latitude


.. _extensionManager-defaultLongitude:

defaultLongitude
----------------

Default longitude

--------------------------------

If you use our maps2 extension your browser will send requests to Google Servers to retrieve the map images.
These requests contains the IP address of the website visitors which is a user defined information in some countries.
User defined information which will be sent to third party servers needs to be explicit allowed by the visitor.
Enable this option, if you need this explicit activation of Google Maps in Cookie.


.. _extensionManager-explicitAllowMapProviderRequestsBySession:

explicitAllowMapProviderRequestsBySession
-----------------------------------------

If you use our maps2 extension your browser will send requests to Google Servers to retrieve the map images.

User defined information which will be sent to third party servers needs to be explicit allowed by the visitor.
Enable this option, if you need this explicit activation of Google Maps for current browser session.

   Firefox stores the browser SESSION on exit by default. So this feature will not work for Firefox browsers except you
   configure your firefox explicit to destroy session vars on close.


.. _extensionManager-infoWindowContentTemplatePath::

infoWindowContentTemplatePath
-----------------------------

You can define your own default template for these little info window content when clicking on a marker.

.. _extensionManager-allowMapTemplatePath::

allowMapTemplatePath
--------------------

This option is only valid if explicitAllowMapProviderRequests is activ.

   record creation.


.. _extensionManager-googleMapsGeocodeUri:

--------------------

When you're searching for an address while creating PoiCollection records maps2 starts a Geocode request to
Google Maps Geocode API. If needed you can change that URI here.
